# OOP Exercise Solutions

This repository contains ten Java programs that mirror common OOP exercises (hospital, school, payroll, hotel, rental, banking, real estate, library, airline, shopping). Each follows the same pattern: a small inheritance chain, encapsulated data, basic validation, user input through `Scanner`, and a final record class that performs a simple calculation.

## Files

- `Question1_HospitalManagement.java`
- `Question2_SchoolManagement.java`
- `Question3_EmployeePayroll.java`
- `Question4_HotelReservation.java`
- `Question5_VehicleRental.java`
- `Question6_BankingSystem.java`
- `Question7_RealEstateManagement.java`
- `Question8_LibraryManagement.java`
- `Question9_AirlineTicketing.java`
- `Question10_OnlineShopping.java`

## Running

Use `javac QuestionX_*.java` to compile and `java QuestionX_*` to run, supplying the prompted inputs when requested.

## Notes

- Minimal exception handling exists for bad inputs.
- Calculations are straightforward additions or percentage checks.
- Output simply echoes what was entered along with the computed value.
